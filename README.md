Please make sure you have everything imported before you run the code :)

Tutorial:
1. This game requires 2 players.
2. Each player gets to go in turns. Each turn placing their chess piece on any of the non-occupied intersections on the board.
3. If either player connects 5 of their own pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally - they win the game and the game ends.
4. (MY OWN RULE) Before each player's turn, the system will automatially roll a dice. If the number is 5, the player gets an extra turn immediately.

Known bugs:
1. Please do not click the board for more than 2 times when the dice is rolling. Some times it may skip the other player's turn.
